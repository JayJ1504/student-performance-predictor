# 🎓 Student Performance Predictor

This project uses machine learning to predict whether a student will pass or fail based on their exam scores and background factors.

---

## 📊 Objective

To build a classification model that predicts student performance (pass/fail) using attributes such as gender, parental education, test preparation, and exam scores.

---

## 🧰 Tech Stack

- Python (pandas, NumPy, seaborn, matplotlib)
- scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook
- Streamlit (optional deployment)

---

## 📁 Dataset

- Source: [Kaggle – Student Performance](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/spscientist/students-performance-in-exams)
- CSV file: `StudentsPerformance.csv`
- Features include: gender, race/ethnicity, parental education, test preparation course, math/reading/writing scores
